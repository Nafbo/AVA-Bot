"People will find out about the handsome profits and call bullshit on the ""saving lives"" meme."
Framing matters.
"The real narrative should be ""incompetent energy policy built on virtue signaling is putting millions of lives at risk."""
"Bitcoin can certainly help by incentivizing the build out of grid capacity above what anyone could ever imagine peak demand to be, but to act like they are acting virtuously when they are turning off because they'll make more money or lock in a lower rate is the wrong approach."
"Instead of taking victory laps about ""bitcoin miners saving lives"" (which isn't what is happening), people who are passionate about bitcoin mining and its place within energy systems should be leaning into the piss poor state of grid systems in the US."

No. That’s what makes it so insane that it’s being pushed as a go-to energy source.
The arctic blast proved that bitcoin miners can help grid stability when they are economically incentivized to do so.  It also proved that solar and wind are least reliable when they are needed most.  More reliable base load + more mining is the solution.   https://t.co/o0aLu8I0jK

"@fewture @w_s_bitcoin @AndreiBehjan @ChartsBtc IIRC most nodes keep blockchain forks in-memory when a reorganization occurs, so a fork that is of a size greater than the available RAM on systems would likely cause the node process to fail due to an out of memory error."
"@w_s_bitcoin @AndreiBehjan @ChartsBtc Would human node operators notice? Definitely. But the nodes just follow the rules.  From a practical standpoint, doing such a long-range reorg would likely crash most nodes. But it's still a valid theoretical attack."
@AndreiBehjan @w_s_bitcoin @ChartsBtc Sounds like you need to learn more about what nodes actually guarantee with regard to validity.  https://t.co/b6G4m6kWLQ
"@AndreiBehjan @w_s_bitcoin @ChartsBtc To be clear, you ""mine privately"" without broadcasting until you have completed hashing the full blockchain fork you want to reorganize the main chain, then you broadcast it.  You still have to follow the validity rules, but the main goal is that your chain has more total PoW."
"@RandallGilberd I think I have one chart regarding distribution of balances across addresses. I general I try not to lean too much on ""on-chain analytics"" that claim to identify wallets / entities given that they use heuristics that are often opaque. It's educated guesswork."
"@w_s_bitcoin @ChartsBtc When you're mining privately to perform a long range reorganization of the blockchain, that's less of an issue because you have more discretion into what the timestamps are of the blocks and thus how the difficulty adjusts."

"✅ allow folks to make the choice that works for them. try and lower barriers to entry for self-custody, but do not force it on everyone."
"✅ insist that CEXes be as credible and accountable as possible, for those that want to/have to use them - support PoR eg ✅ support the development of tools like casa, unchained, and nunchuk which make safe self custody easy and safe  ✅ educate others about these options"
"many funds have been lost to poor self custody setups, and many have been lost to CEXes. it's not a race. let's focus on harm reduction rather than rhetorical point scoring.   self custody is not for everyone, but should they choose to take that option, it should be easy &amp; safe."

"@JordanSchachtel At their best they are digital dollars that don’t need KYC and can be held on a mobile phone, even a burner. Which is pretty useful for a lot of people right now. But agreed long term they probably only sustain or strengthen the establishment machine"

@StachAlex The loss of colonial territories is not a marginal factor for Europe or the West  Ongoing IMF/World Bank control via debt has been useful and ameliorates the loss of direct control   But the entire fiat crisis of the 70s was sparked in part by the independence of oil exporters
One year ago I was reading “The Lords of Easy Money”  An eye-opening book from a unique perspective that helps unpack the social impact of easy US monetary policy and ZIRP over the last 30 years   Highly recommended 👌
@StachAlex They ruled over 3.5 million sq km and 80 million people for several decades. Please stop pretending that this wasn’t a benefit. But also: it’s true they were a relatively minor colonial player. I’m talking about Europe as a unit here. Germany benefitted from other colonialism too

"@StachAlex French colonialism lasted for hundreds of years. I am not implying anything other than the French state has encountered persistent financial difficulties in the post-colonial, post-direct-control-of-energy era"
@StachAlex I didn’t mean to focus on France with my last comment. Europe as an economic unit — including Austria — got all kinds of free stuff from looting the global south for a very long time. Energy is of course a huge one. When that unwound it caused ill effects on Western economies
@StachAlex Thank you!  Consider the oil crisis: you think it is not connected to Western countries like France losing their (price) control over oil resources in former colonial possessions?   In general the effects of decolonization are severely missing in mainstream economic analysis

@rohangrey If you consider the IMF and World Bank and Federal Reserve “capitalist” institutions then you could say I spend a lot of my time condemning capitalism
@rohangrey Ok. Well what I mean by post-fiat system is a world where the global reserve currency is not issued by the US (or any) government  Pretty sure that human communities would still cooperate to provide public services in that world
"@rohangrey So your view is that in a world where the global reserve currency is not issued by government(s), there will be no social welfare programs? Just trying to clarify"
@rohangrey I know you disagree — so who cares — but I consider Bitcoin to be public money. As opposed to money issued by (often unelected) bureaucrats or private corporations etc
@rohangrey What I said with regard to benefits in the US today is a fact. Project all you want but there’s no reason consensual taxes can’t pay for social benefits in a post-fiat system.
"@rohangrey That’s not my argument. But most dictator cash sucks. Go talk to people who live in Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Turkey, Egypt, Russia, etc  What’s bizarre is that you won’t acknowledge the demonstrable help that Bitcoin does provide to people today when public money systems fail"
@rohangrey Most social welfare benefits in the US are actually paid for by taxes. Not by deficit spending. For instance. Sure we might have to cut out the forever wars but I’m cool with that
@rohangrey I happen to think public education and public hospitals are important. No reason they can’t do well in a post-fiat system
"@rohangrey Cash in authoritarian regimes is a very poor monetary tool. In most dictatorships it loses value very quickly and in some prominent cases is demonetized entirely. In the biggest autocracy it is being killed off entirely… so no, I am not interested in defending dictator fiat"
@rohangrey Yes. They have cash *today* — it is a relic of the past. See the CCP for what they want in the future: a cashless society with complete digital financial control
@rohangrey My support for stablecoins is distinct from my support for Bitcoin. Stablecoins are at the moment a humanitarian lifeline. No one can deny this. But if anything they actually reinforce or extend dollar hegemony. Plus are centralized etc. So IMO not a good ultimate solution
@rohangrey I mean. You can have good hospitals. Sure. You can have good public education in some aspects but it will include brainwashing in others. You however most certainly won’t have state-provided privacy tools in authoritarian regimes. For fiat folks best bet is private dollars
@rohangrey You literally can’t have public fiat tools in autocracies that are going to be pro-human rights. 4.3 billion live under authoritarian regimes. I am interested in helping more people get dollar access but that comes with its own complications of increased dependency etc.
@rohangrey I have come to see the importance of stablecoins because millions of people in the Global South and in dictatorships rely on them… I do acknowledge this does not neatly align with my interest in Bitcoin. But I try to be open minded to solutions that are helping people today.
@rohangrey Literally no one is saying that… but people often prefer stablecoins to physical cash for various and obvious reasons (for example they can teleport across borders etc)
@rohangrey I worked in the human rights and democracy field for ~10 years before I got really interested in Bitcoin. My interest has always been in human rights. I’ve never been a libertarian. Always voted progressive. Sorry I don’t fit in your box
🤡
@rohangrey I meant digital
"@rohangrey Because the US government would not allow non KYC use of official dollars in “enemy” countries? This is a non-starter  Dollar hegemony is deeply flawed and globally unequal in many ways, I don’t want to devote my time to strengthening and extending it, no thanks"
"@rohangrey @ameensol @AfroBitcoinOrg Figured out how to send, receive, transact, and save money despite all kinds of restrictions"
"@rohangrey But there is no way to get digital dollar retail “cash” in most of the Global South or in dictatorships except via stablecoins. So it’s a false choice. People in Lebanon or Nigeria can’t get “official” digital dollars. If they could, they’d love that!"
@rohangrey @ameensol @AfroBitcoinOrg A Bitcoin community has thrived in Iran for many years. They figured it out!
Friends in the Global South or authoritarian regimes:  Can you help explain to Rohan why a digital $100 credit that can be received/held/sent via mobile phone might be preferable to a $100 bill?
@rohangrey @ameensol @AfroBitcoinOrg What a silly litmus test. Have mobile encrypted messaging apps ever toppled a dictator? No: but they help dissidents every day.  Also: via the IMF/WB or their own printing press every brutal dictator has been aided by fiat
@rohangrey @ameensol @AfroBitcoinOrg How are you going to get them a slab of greenbacks? Really big carrier pigeon?
@rohangrey @AfroBitcoinOrg What was your answer? Something like bearer-instrument dollar cards? In honesty I can’t perfectly remember.
@rohangrey How do you get privacy-protecting money inside a dictatorship that is neither run by the state (authoritarian) nor by a foreign country or corporation (colonialist)? If you have a good answer you should give a contrary talk about it at @AfroBitcoinOrg next year
"The powers that be would never allow us to use Bitcoin either, if they could have their way"

@RudyHavenstein @MikeBurgersburg @ttmygh @AlderLaneEggs I literally just listened to this today! Absolutely wild. This is why I was disenchanted with parts of my journalism experience. I had stories squashed about corruption because it meant the network would lose precious access to bureaucrats. This is why we can’t have nice things.
"@JoinCrowdHealth @whits23 @SchoonoverAndy @whits23 think of it this way - instead of sending money to an insurance company and never seeing it again whether you get sick or not, you send it to a piggy bank that adds up over time. you can allocate your savings to bitcoin. When you get sick you tap into it or help others."

@ramahluwalia There are on ramps that don’t issue their own unregistered air tokens that are then pledged as collateral (FTX at 20-100x leverage). How is printing your own token then allocating most of it to yourself not the same as counterfeiting?  Paper promises used as real money = fiat

9/ @Cardano shared the same fate as most others with a 65% drop in market cap through Q3 this year.  Cardano’s goal in the near future will be to catch up to established ecosystems and take some market share.  https://t.co/8w2klF1Tim
"8/ ~State of Cardano Ecosystem  @Cardano experienced a surge in Q1 2022 DeFi activity, with daily transactions settling at about 60K in Q3.  Cardano’s DeFi TVL was ~$78M at the end of Q3 2022 with a market cap of ~$14.8B, giving Cardano a Mcap/TVL ratio of ~190.  https://t.co/BMDOZvVWJw"
"7/ ~Tokenomics  $ADA, the native token on @Cardano, is used for P2P transactions, security, and gas fees.  The max supply of ADA is 45B, with 35B $ADA (78%) currently in supply.  https://t.co/NrYyV1u0yU"
"6/ ~Technology cont.  @Cardano also differs from account-based transaction models in that it has multi-asset support.  All tokens, both fungible and non-fungible, share almost all the functionality as $ADA."
"5/ ~Technology cont.  @Cardano's uses a novel version of UTXO called the extended UTXO (eUTXO).  To avoid concurrency risks, dapp developers must find ways to batch transactions to allow simultaneous UTXO interactions within the same block (e.g. @SundaeSwap, @MELD_Defi)."
"4/ ~Technology cont.  @Cardano's modular design operates on two separate layers, the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL), optimized for value transfer, and the Cardano Computing Layer (CCL), optimized for data storage."
"3/ ~Technology  @Cardano was an early adopter of Proof-of-Stake and modularity.  Ouroboros, Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, allows users to delegate their $ADA to a stake pool operator and earn rewards while still retaining ownership of their tokens."
"2/ ~Background  @Cardano's development started in 2015 at the hands of @IOHK_Charles and Jeremy Wood.  Cardano is now supported by three entities (@InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_i0) with a roadmap consisting of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire."

"3/ Why did the proposal fail?  Following the post-mortem, 6 issues were identified that strained @gauntletnetwork's relationship with @AaveAave Dao and impacted performance.  Market conditions from the FTX collapse and the $CRV market short also affected sentiment."
"2/ The Proposal ⬇️  Gauntlet's proposal would've offered @AAVEAave its suite of risk management services for various deployments.  The proposal also included an insolvency fund and optimization of the protocol's interest rate parameters and native stablecoin, $GHO."
1/ In late November @gauntletnetwork proposed to renew its risk management service with @aaveaave DAO.  Ultimately the proposal failed due to bad timing and Gauntlet’s risk management decisions tied to the FTX Collapse and the CRV short.🧵  https://t.co/P7NRm8lJjN

One of my favorite concepts that @slatestarcodex taught me is defining things extensionally. See his extensional defn of high modernism:   https://t.co/J67vkCJGMy  It often really is far more accurate than attempting a self-contained formal description that captures everything.  https://t.co/b1xgGItzFA
"@Leo_Glisic @pujaohlhaver @BuildingWeb4 @glenweyl I favor conditional payments: when you send a message, you pay nothing by default, but you make yourself vulnerable to the recipient burning or charitying your money.  I still think this is a really underrated primitive.   https://t.co/rTUu3DMU0v"
@cafreiman It seems more broadly true that groups that really emphasize being warm and fluffy and egalitarian internally often have a dark side of being unwelcoming to outsiders.  I wonder what the exceptions are and what we can learn from them.
"Another pattern I despise is insisting on a really important difference in meaning to words that sound like synonyms.  ""complex vs complicated"" ""money vs currency"" ""decentralized vs distributed""  No. Stop. Let them be synonyms, use more specific words that clarify the difference."
"Often when a word has a confusing meaning, the most viable path is to just stop using it. ""Fortnightly"" is too obscure; I'd probably just say ""twice per month"" and ""every 2 months"" (eg. ""your salary is $2500 twice per month"") directly."
Recommend this.  Giving money directly to the poorest people in the world is a simple effective way of greatly improving people's lives that we can all get behind.

@glenweyl @onglynette I'd love to hear takes from people who have lived decades in these authoritarian countries!  (I suspect they work differently and some are more suppression-heavy than others)
@TechnophobiaOrg Consumption always has been like 1/3+ about signaling though.
"@glenweyl I don't think this disagrees with my claim? I agree that the objective is not to literally prevent dissemination of arguments and ideas that they dislike, but the primary tool is still censoring rather than flooding."
"@glenweyl I think my model is more, ""not being censored"" is level 1 on a Maslow-style hierarchy of info needs, and once that's reasonably satisfied, focus can and should shift to level 2, which contains ""not being info-flooded"".  (Levels 3+ involve subtler stuff like subtly bad arguments)"
"@glenweyl I'm not convinced by the second sentence. It seems to me that censorship is still a first resort, flooding the information space is a considerably less effective second resort that they revert to in contexts where censorship is impractical (particularly: foreign contexts)."

@KDM271828 @FuturistAvenue @elmajorcorn @finitemaz @rogerkver @bchsunny @nayibbukele As far as you know? I doubt you know more than me about MWEB. It’s not a hidden block increase. An no idea what you mean by data needing to be sent and not counted.
"@KDM271828 @FuturistAvenue @elmajorcorn @finitemaz @rogerkver @bchsunny @nayibbukele Incorrect. Time to first confirmation is important. In 2.5 minutes, Litecoin with 1 confirmation is orders of magnitude more secure than BCH with 0 confirmation. 4 confirmations is also a lot harder to reverse than 1 confirmation in the same amount of time."
"@KDM271828 @FuturistAvenue @elmajorcorn @finitemaz @rogerkver @bchsunny @nayibbukele For small amounts, you don't need proofs. For large amounts, you still need to wait for 1 conf, which is 4 times faster with LTC.  MWEB can scale 10x, which is more than enough. No need for more until necessary as there are always decentralization tradeoffs with onchain scaling."
"@KDM271828 @FuturistAvenue @elmajorcorn @finitemaz @rogerkver @bchsunny @nayibbukele FWIW, Litecoin doesn't have RBF, so 0-conf works just as well as BCH. We've also increased the blocksize more than Bitcoin via MWEB. So it's wrong to claim Litecoin is inferior to Bitcoin Cash w.r.t. speed and scaling."
@SAGARKETO  https://t.co/4llYgtnf7m

@FinneJay @LitecoinGod @DWhitmanBTC @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 It's not a prerequisite for 2nd layer to not have a token.

"@FinneJay @LitecoinGod @DWhitmanBTC @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 Many people use Litecoin as a 2nd layer to Bitcoin because it has low fees and is fast for transfers. You may not find that useful, but many do. I fully support LN and have worked hard towards making LN succeed with my time and money. LN also helps Bitcoin scale but is different."
@LitecoinGod @DWhitmanBTC @FinneJay @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 Less than that. I made more money from Bitcoin and even more from the Ethereum pre-sale. That just shows you how much more money Vitalik made from his creation.  That’s a difference between a fairly launched coins vs a premined coin.
"@FinneJay @LitecoinGod @DWhitmanBTC @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 1) Depends on how lenient you use the word fork, it’s a fork of digicash.

"@LitecoinGod @papablox13 @FinneJay @LTCUnderground @DWhitmanBTC @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 Bitcoin doesn’t care or doesn’t need these people to defend it. Sadly, they think they are helping."

@papablox13 @FinneJay @LTCUnderground @DWhitmanBTC @LitecoinGod @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 It’s basically a religious cult now for these people.
"@FinneJay @LitecoinGod @DWhitmanBTC @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 Time is money. Conviction with time spent is much more real than with money.

@LitecoinGod @FinneJay @DWhitmanBTC @LTCUnderground @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 Maybe he's talking about Satoshi getting rich from promising that Bitcoin can easily scale on chain.
"@DWhitmanBTC @FinneJay @LTCUnderground @LitecoinGod @Excellion @LTCFoundation @jonnylitecoin @DavidBurkett38 I’m just going to assume you are American. Did you realize that we forked British English and American English is a shit language fork? American English is the real English, right?"

"@RachelJBury @JeanSimB623 Plenty of people profited more than I did. And I was transparent with my sells. Afterwards, if people didn't like my move, they could have sold for 50% above my average sell price. And yet I'm still here building value on Litecoin. Do your own research. I'm out."
"@JeanSimB623 @RachelJBury I sold more than a year after it was on Coinbase exchange and 6 months after it was on  https://t.co/1YvGqBzJcE.

@JeanSimB623 @RachelJBury So you prefer a coin where the creator printed 30%+ of coins out of thin air for himself and sold coins without telling anyone over a coin that was fairly launched where the creator mined &amp; bought his coins fairly like every other person and announced his sell to be transparent.
@RachelJBury @JeanSimB623 You called me a criminal without doing any research and you expect me to spend my time to educate you. Spend some time doing your own research on why I sold coins that I've personally bought and mined and how I spent the past 11 years working on ADDING value to Litecoin.
@RachelJBury @JeanSimB623 Litecoin is not a scam. You have no idea what you are talking about. Don't invest in it if you don't understand it. No need to call it a scam or shitcoin though.

"4/ Singapore, the EU, Brazil, and Japan all have crypto frameworks - and the UK is well ahead of the US. But the lack of coordinated standards globally (or any in the US) continues to push business to countries w/ lower regulatory bars - w/ sometimes catastrophic results (FTX)."
3/ No bill is perfect and there likely never will be one that satisfies everyone. But perfect shouldn’t be the enemy of progress - these proposals provide more than a starting point for debate in this new Congress. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

"12/ Conclusion Évidemment, il existe d'autres pays qui auraient pu être inclus au classement et suivant les critères pris en compte, il aurait pu être totalement différent. Ainsi, ce classement a pour seul but de proposer une liste de pays +/- favorable à notre écosystème. 👇"
"11/El Salvador🇸🇻 Comment clôturer ce classement sans évoquer le Salvador, probablement le pays le plus Bitcoin-friendly au monde. Ici, Bitcoin est la monnaie officielle du pays en plus du dollar. Vous pouvez donc en dépenser directement sans devoir passer par une monnaie fiat. 👇"
"10/ Dubaï🇦🇪 Passons désormais à l'un des paradis fiscaux les plus connus : DubaÏ. Outre la qualité de vie exceptionnelle si vous possédez un niveau de vie important, Dubaï est attractif pour les investisseurs crypto car aucune opération n'est soumise à l'impôt. 👇"
"9/ Malte🇲🇹 En plus du soleil et de la qualité de vie agréable, Malte est une destination intéressante pour les investisseurs crypto. En effet, les holders long-terme ne sont pas imposés. Toutefois, si vous exercez en tant que professionnel, vous serez taxé de 0 à 10%. 👇"
"8/ Suisse🇨🇭 La Suisse est un pays propice à l'innovation. Le pays accueille des start up comme Swissborg ou MtPelerin mais aussi le siège de la Fondation Ethereum dans sa ""crypto-valley"" à Zoug. De plus, les plus-values sur les cryptomonnaies ne sont pas imposées dans le pays. 👇"
"7/ Allemagne🇩🇪 Dans l'UE, l'Allemagne est probablement un des pays les plus crypto-friendly. En effet, c'était l'un des premiers pays européens à adopter des réformes positives. Elle propose aussi une taxation avantageuse pouvant descendre à 0% si la détention dépasse 1 an. 👇"
"6/France🇫🇷 La France tend à devenir le hub européen des cryptomonnaies en Europe. Le gouvernement avait récemment annoncé vouloir investir pour développer le secteur. Toutefois, la fiscalité est contraignante pour les investisseurs avec la ""flat tax"" de 30% sur les plus-value. 👇"
"5/ USA🇺🇸 Dans le pays, l'adoption à travers la population est très avancée. C'est aussi aux USA que se situent les principaux investisseurs institutionnels. Toutefois, la régulation locale est très stricte et la fiscalité peu avantageuse, avec des bénéfices taxés jusqu'à 37%. 👇"
"4/ Russie🇷🇺 Le positionnement du pays est assez flou envers les crypto. En effet, leur utilisation comme moyen de paiement est interdite mais l'usage dans le commerce international est en développement. Enfin, Poutine affirmait détenir un ""avantage compétitif"" dans le mining. 👇"
"3/Turquie🇹🇷 Dans ce pays, la situation monétaire est complexe. Pour lutter contre la forte inflation, les citoyens turcs investissent dans Bitcoin. Le pays ne possède pas de cadre réglementaire. Toutefois, la banque centrale turc avait interdit en 2021 les paiements en crypto. 👇"
"2/ Chine🇨🇳 En bas du classement, on retrouve ce pays hostile à l'innovation et à l'écosystème. En effet, en Chine, toutes activités liées au mining, au trading ou autres transactions en cryptomonnaies sont illégales. Le pays développe sa #CBDC pour lutter contre ces actifs. 👇"
"1/ Introduction Pour établir ce classement non officiel, nous avons pris en compte plusieurs paramètres tel que : - La position du gouvernement envers l'écosystème - La législation fiscale en vigueur - La part de la population ayant adopté ce nouveau moyen de paiement. 👇"
Thread / 👀  Classement des pays à privilégier et à éviter pour les investisseurs crypto !! Un petit classement des 10 pays plus ou moins crypto-friendly. 👇
